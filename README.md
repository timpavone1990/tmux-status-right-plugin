# tmux status right plugin

This plugin sets the `status-right` option to only include the mode indicator of the [tmux prefix highlight plugin](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-prefix-highlight).
It is useful, if you want to override the `status-right` value set by your theme plugin.
Therefore, this plugin must be applied between the theme plugin and the [tmux prefix highlight plugin](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-prefix-highlight).
